"""ICANN reporting BigQuery query construction logic.

The IcannReportQueryBuilder class contains logic for constructing the
multi-part BigQuery queries used to produce ICANN monthly reports.  These
queries are fairly complicated; see the design doc published to the
domain-registry-users@googlegroups.com for an overview.

Currently, this class only supports building the query for activity
reports (not transaction reports).

# the log message, plus the 'EPP Command' string, up to the newline.
# Queries used below depend on matching this log line and parsing its
# exact format, so it must be kept in sync with the logging site.
