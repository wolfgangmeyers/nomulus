-- Credit Balance Data View SQL
--
-- This query post-processes RegistrarCreditBalance entities to collapse them
-- down to one 'true' amount per credit ID and effective time, eliminating any
-- duplicates by choosing the most recently written balance entry of the set,
-- and then joins these 'real' balances to the CreditData view.
--
-- The result is a list showing how each credit's balance has developed over
-- time, which can be used to find the actual balance of a given credit at
-- any particular point in time (e.g. the time when invoices are run).
