    This list contains reserve terms for the TLD. Other terms may be reserved
    but not included in this list, including terms Donuts Inc. chooses not
    to publish, and terms that ICANN commonly mandates to be reserved. This
    list is subject to change and the most up-to-date source is always to
    check availability directly with the Registry server.

    Terms of Use: Users accessing the Donuts WHOIS service must agree to use the data
    only for lawful purposes, and under under no circumstances use the data to: Allow,
    enable, or otherwise support the transmission by e-mail, telephone, or facsimile
    of mass unsolicited, commercial advertising or solicitations to entities other
    than the registrar's own existing customers. Enable high volume, automated,
    electronic processes that send queries or data to the systems of Donuts or
    any ICANN-accredited registrar, except as reasonably necessary to register
    domain names or modify existing registrations. When using the Donuts Whois
    service, please consider the following: The Whois service is not a replacement
    for standard EPP commands to the SRS service. Whois is not considered authoritative
    for registered domain objects. The Whois service may be scheduled for downtime
    during production or OT&E maintenance periods. Queries to the Whois services are
    throttled. If too many queries are received from a single IP address within a
    specified time, the service will begin to reject further queries for a period of
    time to prevent disruption of Whois service access.
